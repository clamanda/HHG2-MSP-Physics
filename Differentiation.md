# Overview of what differentiation is:

Differentiation is, by definition, the way to find a function that represents the rate of change of one variable with respect to another variable. To begin simply, we will take a variable that changes across time, like a car traveling along a road for a defined amount of time. By differentiating this, we can find the velocity. By further differentiating that, the acceleration can be found. Why this is will be further discussed below:

The primary motivation for understanding and using differentiation was the tangent line problem, that is, for a curved graph, what is the slope that is tangent to it at a given point. Thus, by solving the slope of the curve at that point, the tangent problem can be solved. In many cases finding the slope may be easy. If a graph has the equation y=mx+b, m already represents the slope. It becomes more difficult if your graph follows an equation similar to y=cos(x)+x3at x=2. 

The next step involves understanding what the slope is, and how it can be rewritten to something that looks like a differentiation. The slope/gradient of a curve is commonly expressed as “rise over run” where over a straight line finite line, the slope can be expressed as the total distance it travels over the y-axis (the rise) divided by the total distance it travels with respect to the x-axis (the run). In other words, it is the change of variables within the y-axis divided by the change in variables in the x-axis. This change is known as delta (Δ). Going back to the example of the car going down a road, if it travels 30 metres in 5 seconds, and we take the distance to be the y-axis and the time to be the x-axis, then the slope represents 305m/sor 6m/s; the velocity. 

It won't always be as easy as this though, as most graphs in physics are curved, which makes getting the slope much harder to get. In this way, a tangential line is used to represent the slope at a given point. The definition of a tangent is something that only just touches the line, such as in the image below. The point that it intersects at is infinitesimally small, and will from now on be referred to as “d” instead of delta (which represents a finite difference). Therefor, the slope at a tangential point on the graph of position versus time will be written as dxdt; a differentiation.
